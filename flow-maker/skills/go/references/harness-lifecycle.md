# harness-lifecycle.md — go's harness create / update / archive (force-load)

The operational rules for go's harness step: detecting first-vs-delta, generating or updating the
harness, and archiving the 3-doc. Runs **after the completion gate, before the final review**.
Load alongside `harness-format.md` (the harness spec) — this file is the *process*, that one is the
*spec*.

## First-cycle vs delta — the `status.json` marker

`.flow-maker/status.json` is a **local-only marker** (it lives inside the gitignored `.flow-maker/`, so
it is not committed — local is by design). Its content is one fact: `{ "initialized": true }`. It is
written at the **successful finish** of a first cycle (after the user approves the harness — see
"Archiving" below) or by `migration` on completion.

- **Marker present (`initialized: true`)** → the harness already exists → this cycle is a **delta**.
- **Marker absent** → this cycle is **first-cycle** (create the harness).

This is the whole detection rule — simple on purpose. Consequences:

- **Pre-finish failure → first-cycle on retry.** If a first cycle fails *before* the marker is
  written (during harness generation, final review, the user gate, or archiving), the marker is
  absent, so a retry re-enters **first-cycle** and regenerates. The in-progress harness files from
  the failed run are unapproved, so overwriting them is correct. The 3-doc stays active (not yet
  archived), so the retry has its sources.
- **Safety guard against clobbering.** If first-cycle is detected (no marker) **but** a harness
  structure already exists on disk (an entry file (CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) with the harness
  navigation structure + a populated `docs/`) — e.g. a fresh clone where the committed harness is
  present but the local marker isn't — do **not** blindly overwrite it. Stop and ask the user
  whether to treat it as an existing harness (delta) or regenerate. (escalate-don't-guess; never
  destroy a harness you didn't just generate.)

## 3-doc re-read (mandatory, both modes)

Before generating/updating, **re-read `.flow-maker/{handoff,spec,plan}.md`.** By this point the session
context is code-biased (you just implemented); re-reading restores the design intent so the harness
reflects the *intended* project, not just the code as written.

## First cycle — create the whole harness

Sources, in priority: the handoff's **Project Foundation** (`foundation-format.md`) → spec (design
intent) → code (implementation fact). The Foundation's richness sets the harness's richness.

- **Foundation is a first-cycle invariant — fail-fast if absent.** `ready` always writes the
  Foundation in a first cycle (`foundation-format.md`, "First-cycle precondition"). So a first-cycle
  handoff with **no Foundation section** is a **precondition violation, not a degrade case** — do
  **not** guess a Foundation from spec + code. **Stop and ask the user to regenerate the 3-doc via
  `ready`** (escalate-don't-guess). This is a one-line precondition check, not a fallback mode.

Generate to `harness-format.md`:
1. If a CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md exists, back each one up to `.flow-maker/backup/`, review it
   critically, propose the disposition to the user, and rewrite only approved content.
2. The whole `docs/` structure (all files).
3. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (identical content).
4. A module AGENTS.md per implemented module.

Map the Foundation to files per `foundation-format.md` (domain → business-rules; technical →
architecture + security + standards + operations; identity → the entry-point overview; future scope
→ status.md's "remaining"). Future-scope content with no code yet is correct, not a hallucination.

## Delta — update only the changed scope

1. **Read all current `docs/` files first** and treat them as the existing project constraint — this
   catches non-flow-maker hand-edits (there is no separate change-tracking).
2. Identify this cycle's change scope from the **3-doc task scope + the code diff**.
3. Judge which `docs/` files are affected (`harness-format.md`, "which file to touch") — your
   reasoning decides, but reviewing every relevant file is the floor.
4. Apply a **scope-limited** update; leave content outside the change scope untouched (whether
   hand-edited or written by a prior flow-maker run).
5. Where this cycle must change something that already holds different content **in scope** →
   **escalate to the user** (don't silently overwrite).
6. status.md every cycle; engineering-notes.md gets non-obvious facts found while implementing;
   decisions/ gets this cycle's trade-off decisions (only if they meet the criterion); findings.md
   updated on find/resolve.
7. A new module → create its AGENTS.md **and** update the navigation tree in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.

**Delta is bidirectional.** Also verify this cycle's change hasn't invalidated an existing statement
elsewhere — updating stale content matters as much as adding new content.

## Archiving the 3-doc (after user approval)

After the user approves (final user gate), **move** the active 3-doc into `.flow-maker/NNN/`: copy
`.flow-maker/{handoff,spec,plan}.md` into the new `.flow-maker/NNN/` (sequential number: highest existing
+ 1, e.g. `001`, `002`, ...) **and then delete them from the `.flow-maker/` root.** Archiving is a *move,
not a copy* — after it, the root holds **no active 3-doc** (only `NNN/` archives, `status.json`,
`backup/`). This matters: if the root copies are left, the next cycle's producer finds a stale
previous-cycle 3-doc at the root and has to disambiguate + overwrite it; moving leaves a clean root so
the next producer just writes a fresh 3-doc. Then write `.flow-maker/status.json`
(`{ "initialized": true }`) if not already present — the marker for the next cycle. (First cycle: the
Foundation is archived with the handoff; from the next cycle the harness carries project context, so
no Foundation is produced.)

## Re-run after a fix

If the final review triggers a fix:
- **Code changed** → re-run the completion gate (the base SHA moved).
- **Harness changed** → re-run the harness review (lenses 3–4).
- **Both changed** → re-run both.

Do not approve/archive until the re-run is green.

## Out-of-scope review finding

If the final review surfaces a code/doc mismatch in a **document region outside this cycle's change
scope**, do **not** fix it this cycle — that would break scope-limited delta. Record it in
`docs/tracking/findings.md` (with *why it can't be resolved now*) and leave it for a later cycle or
manual handling.

## Universality guard

Stack-agnostic. What a module, a contract, or a representative flow is — and which `docs/` file a
change touches — is discovered from the project at runtime, never assumed.
